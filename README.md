• Notebooks 2s and 3s -> Classification on the Rating of the stories with language models as well as with simpler learning algorithms ;

• Notebooks 4s -> Classification on the Popularity of the stories;

• Notebook 5 -> Creation of a network of similar authors with Word2Vec;

• Notebook 6 -> Sentiment Analysis at the sentence level, and temporal-based clustering with respect to the sentiment structure of the stories.

The PDF report contains extensive commentary on our worflow and thought process, as well as a collection of the most interesting charts and tables.
